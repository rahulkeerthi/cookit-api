The Vurger Co,London,E1 6LD,"Unit 9, Avant Garde Building","6 Richmix Square, Cygnet Street","We started as a small market stall back in 2016, to solve a desperate need for plant based fast food in London. Having quickly realised that our customers wanted the full experience from us, we developed from market stall to events, pop ups, festivals and progressed to crowdfunding our first ever restaurant in Shoreditch in March 2018 and have even managed to open our second site in Canary Wharf in November 2018 with our next brand new site coming to Brighton soon!
